## Northampton heat islands

## Heat islands and tree canopy

The heat islands are all associated with low tree canopy. These maps show surface temperature and tree canopy separately:

When the **two maps are overlaid**, the relationship between tree canopy and heat is clear: hotter areas have lower canopy. Areas shown in [**pink**]{style="color: #b673a0;"} have high temperatures and low canopy. Areas in [**green**]{style="color: #5bb27f;"} have low temperature and high canopy.

Plotting temperature against canopy coverage also shows the relationship between the two:
